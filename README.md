# CSCI 349 Final Project: Formula One Driver Performance Analysis

### Team Members:
- Sean O'Connor
- Connor Coles

### Project Summary
We are conducting a data mining project focused on analyzing driver performance in Formula One racing. Our goal is to correlate driver performance with track and weather conditions, and to predict future race results using these correlations. We will apply various data mining techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
